Please implement any kind of client-server solution.
It doesnâ€™t really matter what it does as long as it satisfies following requirements
-	There should ASP.Net Core 3 server application
-	There should .Net Core 3 client application (console app is fine)
-	Client should be able to perform Http request to Server application to receive data
-	Think about how we could implement server to client communication. (there is no need to implement anything here just propose some ideas)
-	Please push client and server to github
